    # matrix 'vocab' where each row is a kmeans centroid or visual word. This  #

    # image_feats is an N x d matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the     #
    # feature representation. In this case, d will equal the number of clusters#
    # or equivalently the number of entries in each image's histogram.         #
    #                                                                          #
    # You will construct SIFT features here in the same way you did in         #
    # build_vocabulary (except for possibly changing the sampling rate)        #
    # and then assign each local feature to its nearest cluster center         #
    # and build a histogram indicating how many times each cluster was used.   #
    # Don't forget to normalize the histogram, or else a larger image with more#
    # SIFT features will look very different from a smaller version of the same#
    # image.                                                                   #
